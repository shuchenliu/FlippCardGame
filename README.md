 The rule is to find all 8 pair of cards that share the same icon.  Click on a card to flip it and to reveal the icon it bears.
 
 A game will automatically start as the first card is clicked on and the clock will kick off.

### A matched pair
If a valid pair is found, the cards will be locked faced-up. If two cards clicked do not have the same icon, they both will flip back to face-down.
